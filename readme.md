## About
This project is a rewrite and extension of my previous work
[WEBGLCS](https://github.com/Quoteme/webglcs).
The main goal is to update the code to modern standarts and
to make it easier to maintain.
This is accomplished by using modern programming features and
different parasigms.

## Features
core features include:
- clean (mostly) declarative functional programming
- use of new JavaScript APIs and features
- hight modularity
	- many new libraries as a side product
	- easy to reuse code
